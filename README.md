### About the Experiment 

Different microorganisms (microbes) require various factors to develop and endure. These elements are physical or chemical characteristics that specify the microbe's habitat. An organism is considered obligatory because some aspects have stringent requirements for those elements to thrive. Additionally, certain microbes may be facultative for particular characteristics, meaning they may live in environments with or without them. Numerous environmental elements have an impact on microbial development. The five physical variables that are most crucial are pH, temperature, oxygen, pressure, and salinity.
